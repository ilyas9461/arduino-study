Voluntary training activities on Arduino that I did with high school students before the pandemic period were shared.

A curriculum suitable especially for high school level has been determined, many foreign and domestic resources have been scanned and course contents have been prepared by combining the experiences gained.

The curriculums used are open source, translated from English, rearranged according to age groups and supported with slides.

The applications are designed considering the mathematics-physics skills of high school students.

I think it will be a good start for students who want to choose the software field in the future to get acquainted with software and hardware.

I hope it will be useful to those interested...
